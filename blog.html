- What was most challenging about this assignment was keeping track of where things are and what they do. A lot of the time I had to input comments to get around this.
What I learned from this assignment was mostly how to format certain shapes and spaces, and what works and what doesn't. 

I found that I already knew how to change the color easily, and I did it with no problem. However, because I for some reason couldn't access the "drop" option to 
get a color from an existing place, I eyeballed it with a hexadecimal conversion site.

One thing I had to google to complete the assignment was how to move images. I at first thought it was a much more complicated process, but it wasn't. It was simpler
than I thought.
